      <h2>Chicken Alfredo Recipe</h2>
        <p>For Chicken Alfredo Pasta, you have 3 main components, all of which are delicious on their own and even more amazing once combined:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><Strong>Chicken:</Strong> Chicken breasts are seasoned and pan seared in olive oil and butter until moist on the inside, with a golden crust on the outside. We keep the seasonings simple with just salt, pepper, and our homemade Italian seasoning blend, since so much additional flavor comes from the cream sauce.</li>
          <li><Strong>Pasta:</Strong> Pasta is cooked in salted water until al dente, which is the bed of this dish. A long, flat noodle like Fettuccine is perfect here, providing more surface area for the sauce to cling to. Linguini is another great choice, or penne which is able to catch the sauce in its ridges. Honestly though, any pasta works.</li>
          <li><Strong>Alfredo Sauce:</Strong> We used our favorite Alfredo Sauce recipe for this dish. Butter, heavy whipping cream, freshly grated Parmesan cheese, garlic, and seasonings come together in a matter of minutes for the most incredible white sauce that coats the cooked pasta. Heaven!</li>
        </ul>


      <h2>How to Make Chicken Alfredo</h2>
        <p>This dish comes together fast, so have everything ready to go. Here’s a summary:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><Strong>Boil the noodles:</Strong> Cook the Fettuccine al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
            <li><Strong>Cook the chicken:</Strong> Season the chicken, then pan-fry in oil and butter, for 6 minutes a side, or until an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest for a few minutes, then cut into 1/2-inch thick slices. Tent with foil, while you prepare the sauce.</li>
            <li><Strong>Make the Alredo sauce:</Strong> Using the same pan you used to cook the chicken, the cream, butter, and seasonings are incorporated and simmered on medium-low heat until thickened, then the Parmesan is added in until melted and smooth.</li>  
            <li><Strong>Assemble:</Strong> Drain the pasta, reserving some of the liquid to loosen the sauce (only if necessary.) Toss immediately with the Alfredo sauce. Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of cooked chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
          </ol>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>

            <ol>

              <li><Strong> Make the noodles:</Strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the fettuccine and cook until al dente according to package directions, usually 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water, then drain well. Set aside.</li>
              <li><Strong> Make the chicken:</Strong> Season chicken breasts with the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper.</li>
              <li>Warm the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet. Once it’s shimmering, swirl the pan to evenly distribute. Add the chicken and leave it undisturbed for 5-7 minutes, until the bottom is golden-brown. Flip over and add in 1 tablespoon of butter between them, picking up the pan to give it a gentle swirl to distribute. Continue cooking for another 5-7 minutes (or an internal temperature reaches 165 degrees F.)</li>
              <li>Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 3 minutes. Cut into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Tent with foil while you prepare the sauce.</li>
              <li><Strong>Make the Alfredo sauce:</Strong> In the same pan, over medium-low heat, add the butter and cream; whisk until butter has melted.</li>
              <li>Add in the minced garlic, garlic powder, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper; whisk until combined and smooth.</li>
              <li>Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil) and cook for 3-4 minutes, whisking constantly, until it starts to thicken.</li>
              <li>Stir in the parmesan cheese just until melted and the sauce is smooth. (If the sauce ends up too thick, add some of the reserved pasta cooking water, a few tablespoons at a time, to thin it out.)</li>
              <li><Strong>Assemble:</Strong> Take sauce off the heat and immediately toss with the cooked fettuccine noodles.</li> 
              <li>Divide the pasta among serving bowls and top with a few slices of chicken. Garnish with parsley, more Parmesan, and black pepper if desired.</li>
