  <h1>Gelato</h1>
  <img src="../Pictures/Gelato.jpeg">
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Gelato, literally meaning “frozen,” is smooth, round and colorful. Though found around the world, real Italian gelato is created by skilled artisans who take pride in their creations. There are quite a few characteristics that set gelato apart from ice cream. The combination of all natural ingredients, less air, and less butterfat give gelato a more intense and unique flavor. Gelato is also creamier due to the extreme skill and care of its makers. It is mixed by hand or machine until semi-frozen; this prevents the large ice crystals from forming. No artificial colorings or flavorings are used in authentic Italian gelato.</p>

    <p>This basic recipe may be used as a base for your favorite flavors. Try adding vanilla, shaved chocolate, or your favorite fruits. Experiment with desired flavors!</p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups of milk</li>
        <li>1 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
      </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour the warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon. If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. Cover, and chill for several hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and freeze until firm. If the gelato is too firm, place it in the refrigerator until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
